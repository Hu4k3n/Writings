day 2 :
        things that make you happy 

    Happiness. It really is a funny word. What makes someone happy.
    In one word ? Dopamine ?
    Meh ! Aside from the chemical that messes with your brain 'normal'
    humans (Yes the author is legit an alien) forget that it was 
    never meant for the brain at all.
    If it was meant for the brain in the first place it would be too 
    simple and would occur to anyone quicker than you could say "Dopamine"
    
    Some humans find it in music, others find it in art, others 
    in the presence of someone they know or love (Wow another funny word,
    thats a journal for another day). What many of us fail to see is that 
    it has a secret stalker, Mrs. Passion. (Look at me i putting 
    pholosophical shit). Why Mrs Passion is married coz she is one 
    stubborn lady to the stubborn human heart, and happiness is her way 
    of shoving red wine into your "aortic pumps" (FRIENDS reference there)
    (Haha...). Still doesnt explain how she is married but who cares, Im writing.
    
    Well the topic was my happiness ... Well what I find happiness is making 
    someone smile irrespective of how their relationship to me. I know its 
    a totally "high horse" stuff (you are gonna be like "Oh my god you are so 
    selfless" and shit well im not). It is what I feel like the only non-fake 
    part of me that Im proud of. Yea the rest of it is all a mask.
    Hell even this version you see in this text need not be the real me.
        Truth is always hidden between the verses
        (Me increasing the distance between the lines)
    For me the smile for the smallest things dissolves the dopamine in the 
    red wines in my "aortic pumps"
    (Voices in my head: Oooo I see what you did there) 
    (Me : /chuckles)

    day 3 :
        Memories 

    Here's to the ones that we got 
    Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not 
        [Wait what ?!!]  
    'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
        [NOOO !! Idiot ! Tell one of your memories] 
    Of everything we've been ...
        (self-realization)
        [Totally] 
    Ohhh i was wondering why you were asking me instead of googling the lyrics.
    So today is what we should remind ourselves abt something.
        [Ahem Ahem the Embarassing stuff]
    Ok fine ! I woke up one fine morning ready to go to school. Today was something different 
    I could feel it.
        [Yep pretty special *biting down a laugh*]
        (me ignoring).
    Well I put on my favorite white shirt ...
        [What do you mean favourite, you wore a uniform, all were white ?! 
        How dumb were you ?]
        (But, this is the THAT one)
        [Oh ok]   
    I was waiting for the bus, you might be wondering something was about 
    to happen in the bus, but SPOILER alert nothing happened in the bus 
    but something happened at the stop. 
        [What ?]
    My brother gave me my fountain pen which i forgot at home.
        [Sheesh ! Can you BE more boring ?!]{Chandler reference for the dumb ones}
        (I see what you did there ! haha)
        [Fast Forward already its getting boring]
    Fine ! It was English period and i was super undisiplined [Word] AND 
    a stupid friend of mine ripped out the plasctic paper covering the 
    brown paper of my book and told me that the vibration of the paper 
    through wind from blowing will be strong enough to produce ultrasonic sound.
        [Wow how old were you ? This is some high-level-shit]
        (Actually thats what it sounded in my head, He just said 'oothiyaal sound varum')
        [Dumb Nerd]
    I, being a pioneer in physics decided to prove him wrong.
        [PIONEER ! God you do know how to exaggerate *hagrid laughter* ]
    You see ultrasonic sound still cannot be heard by you humans so i was safe in 
    conducting these experiments in class [Oh ok :) ]
    It was a nice evening of Shakespearean prose and the maam 
    was passionately explaining the love and betrayal in the lines of the 
    King of Literature, she was walking across the benches slowly digesting 
    the silence the class provided before the loud ...
    SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!!!!
        [*bursts out laughing*]

    She looked to her right and i was there holding the 2 ends of the plastic paper 
    with my nimble fingers like a village idiot, My face red with the effort 
    i had to put to make the sound go ultrasonic.
        [HAHAHAHA Well you were proved wrong though coz the sound has to through the 
        audible range to go ultrasonic though HAHAHAHA]
        (Wasn't this embaressing enough)
        [What happened next ?]
    Oh i was made the OUTSTANDING student and i had to write notes outside of class.
    Of course the entire class followed YOUR instinct but the guy next to me 
        (Yea the same stupid friend) was not ONLY LAUGHING BUT WAS POINTING AT ME ALSO
        [But ....]
    Yes you guessed it gravity cheats you like bankers wife if you use a fountain pen
    without a desk
        [This shit is interesting ]
    Frustrated, humiliated, i shook the stupid pen and ...
    SPLUCK
    Ink all over THAT shirt.
        [*laughing like a maniac*]
    The maam saw this she started smiling and you know 
    the old Huraken charms always works
        (smiling weakly)
        [I heard that part but im gonna assume that that bit got drowned
        in the sound of my laughter]
        [Oh man you should write a book abt this]
        (i already did)
        [Oh then you should put it somewhere coz this memory 
        deserves a prize beyond GOLD HAHAHA!]
    

day 4 : 
        Places

        [So whats on todays agenda]
    It seems i have to say about the places i want to visit
        [Open your hand]
        *opens there is a bunch of keys*
        (...)
        [What ?!]
        Im actually waiting for you to explain
        [Go and use it]
        (*opens a door with the key*)
    The winds gushed inwards the indigo ink spread the skies alongside 
    starry gleam. Where am I ? Surrounding me is a metal scaffolding and
    having diamond nets and telescopes. I went closer to the edge and saw the 
    brightly lit city. There was a small sound of "City of Lights Instrumental"
    lingering in the background. This cannot be that good. 

    There was someone beside me, although i was not wearing my glasses, I 
    could picture a woman in red skirt which blended perfectly with the dimly lit candles.
        [That doesnt make sense You said the place was gushing with wind? How could a candle 
        stay lit there?]
        (Well the candles had a glass casing that prevented air from entering or they could be 
        electric. Im not sure)
    The woman was waiting for me at a table set up at the edge of the rafts overlooking the glorius city.
    I sat next to her, I was somehow wearing a perfect silver tuxedo, 
        [Oooo tuxedo, Who do you think you are James Bond a ?]
        (Hehe)
    Where are we ? 
    I asked her, she turned her face,she just stared at me it was all blurry i could not
     make out any of her fine features.
        (Fine features ? How the hell do i know if its fine when i cant even see her ?)
        [You dont get it do you ?]
        (...)
        [This is a part of your dream where you are always happy or what Phoebe say 
        the "Happy Place" you have told me about this place a million times, well 
        whenever you are super sleepy though]
        (I dont remember any of this, but this does feel familiar)
        [Yea i talk with your subconcious mind all the time, Unlike you that guy is way
        more of a good listener than you]
        (Har Har )
        [Why dont you guess where you think you are its your mind anyway]
    Hmm... This is a bit weird the white table we sat together was a dinner table, a round one
    with a white cloth covering it. Maybe i could yank the cloth quickly and impress her ...
        [No. Dont. Why would anyone do that ?!!]
        (Oh ok)
    The sky and ground (According to gravity) looked a lot similiar coz both` was gleaming 
    with bright lights. He was right about one thing, I was happy. It was as if I had to stay at
    a place between the sky with interstellar beauty above and a stunning copycat below to find 
    peace. Between two starry canvasses. It was perfect
        [AreWahh!! What poetry!! Like 'Gum is Perfection']
        (Shut up )
        [Yes Mr. Tagore]
    But none of these natural beauty is what made me euphoric. somehow this person next to 
    me is the reason that all of it happened to me. The reason why i wanted any of this. Why ?
        [You want me to explain. Be warned Ill be super philosophical]
        (When was the last time you did not intervene my poetic monologue)
        [There was nothing poetic or monologue in this entry dude. All that matters
        is my philosophical critical analysis]
        (Woow thats a lot of big words. Did you use the thesaurus there ?)
        [its funny coz im using your hands to let this guy, THE GUY READING IT, know what
        the hell is happeneing ]
        (Oof breaking the fourth wall and all. Ok go on)
    [For me the place was just a setting as you said a mere canvas art. It has no meaning 
    there unless something happens there. Any place is a blank canvas waiting to be 
    exploited by the artist to make it to tell a story. White. All the colors in the world 
    are there but its still plane at the same time. White is an Emotionless beauty. Flaws 
    in the spectrum is what makes it beautiful to our eyes, the reason anything has a story. 
    People say that the destination is not what makes them happy, It is the people you meet in the journey.
    These people whom you ll never see again in your life paints the story in that canvas of that place.
    For me what i wanted was to spend time anywhere with someone who matters. The place 
    never did coz it was just a canvas, the person is a painting, ths story in the canvas
    the deeper art that eludes the unwise eye ] 

    (You do know that you are literally  Mr.Voice-in-my-head ? and whenever you say "For me"
    it literally freaks me out. Do i have schizophrenia or something)
    [I dont know dude you tell me, Tyler Durden]
    (*nervous laughter*)
    (You see i wanna say " i see what you did there " there, but im not sure anymore )
    ["Alas thus start your slow spiral to madness"]
    (Haha ... I see what you did there )
