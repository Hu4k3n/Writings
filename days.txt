day 2 :
        things that make you happy 

    Happiness. It really is a funny word. What makes someone happy.
    In one word ? Dopamine ?
    Meh ! Aside from the chemical that messes with your brain 'normal'
    humans (Yes the author is legit an alien) forget that it was 
    never meant for the brain at all.
    If it was meant for the brain in the first place it would be too 
    simple and would occur to anyone quicker than you could say "Dopamine"
    
    Some humans find it in music, others find it in art, others 
    in the presence of someone they know or love (Wow another funny word,
    thats a journal for another day). What many of us fail to see is that 
    it has a secret stalker, Mrs. Passion. (Look at me i putting 
    pholosophical shit). Why Mrs Passion is married coz she is one 
    stubborn lady to the stubborn human heart, and happiness is her way 
    of shoving red wine into your "aortic pumps" (FRIENDS reference there)
    (Haha...). Still doesnt explain how she is married but who cares, Im writing.
    
    Well the topic was my happiness ... Well what I find happiness is making 
    someone smile irrespective of how their relationship to me. I know its 
    a totally "high horse" stuff (you are gonna be like "Oh my god you are so 
    selfless" and shit well im not). It is what I feel like the only non-fake 
    part of me that Im proud of. Yea the rest of it is all a mask.
    Hell even this version you see in this text need not be the real me.
        Truth is always hidden between the verses
        (Me increasing the distance between the lines)
    For me the smile for the smallest things dissolves the dopamine in the 
    red wines in my "aortic pumps"
    (Voices in my head: Oooo I see what you did there) 
    (Me : /chuckles)

    day 3 :
        Memories 

    Here's to the ones that we got 
    Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not 
        [Wait what ?!!]  
    'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
        [NOOO !! Idiot ! Tell one of your memories] 
    Of everything we've been ...
        (self-realization)
        [Totally] 
    Ohhh i was wondering why you were asking me instead of googling the lyrics.
    So today is what we should remind ourselves abt something.
        [Ahem Ahem the Embarassing stuff]
    Ok fine ! I woke up one fine morning ready to go to school. Today was something different 
    I could feel it.
        [Yep pretty special *biting down a laugh*]
        (me ignoring).
    Well I put on my favorite white shirt ...
        [What do you mean favourite, you wore a uniform, all were white ?! 
        How dumb were you ?]
        (But, this is the THAT one)
        [Oh ok]   
    I was waiting for the bus, you might be wondering something was about 
    to happen in the bus, but SPOILER alert nothing happened in the bus 
    but something happened at the stop. 
        [What ?]
    My brother gave me my fountain pen which i forgot at home.
        [Sheesh ! Can you BE more boring ?!]{Chandler reference for the dumb ones}
        (I see what you did there ! haha)
        [Fast Forward already its getting boring]
    Fine ! It was English period and i was super undisiplined [Word] AND 
    a stupid friend of mine ripped out the plasctic paper covering the 
    brown paper of my book and told me that the vibration of the paper 
    through wind from blowing will be strong enough to produce ultrasonic sound.
        [Wow how old were you ? This is some high-level-shit]
        (Actually thats what it sounded in my head, He just said 'oothiyaal sound varum')
        [Dumb Nerd]
    I, being a pioneer in physics decided to prove him wrong.
        [PIONEER ! God you do know how to exaggerate *hagrid laughter* ]
    You see ultrasonic sound still cannot be heard by you humans so i was safe in 
    conducting these experiments in class [Oh ok :) ]
    It was a nice evening of Shakespearean prose and the maam 
    was passionately explaining the love and betrayal in the lines of the 
    King of Literature, she was walking across the benches slowly digesting 
    the silence the class provided before the loud ...
    SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!!!!
        [*bursts out laughing*]

    She looked to her right and i was there holding the 2 ends of the plastic paper 
    with my nimble fingers like a village idiot, My face red with the effort 
    i had to put to make the sound go ultrasonic.
        [HAHAHAHA Well you were proved wrong though coz the sound has to through the 
        audible range to go ultrasonic though HAHAHAHA]
        (Wasn't this embaressing enough)
        [What happened next ?]
    Oh i was made the OUTSTANDING student and i had to write notes outside of class.
    Of course the entire class followed YOUR instinct but the guy next to me 
        (Yea the same stupid friend) was not ONLY LAUGHING BUT WAS POINTING AT ME ALSO
        [But ....]
    Yes you guessed it gravity cheats you like bankers wife if you use a fountain pen
    without a desk
        [This shit is interesting ]
    Frustrated, humiliated, i shook the stupid pen and ...
    SPLUCK
    Ink all over THAT shirt.
        [*laughing like a maniac*]
    The maam saw this she started smiling and you know 
    the old Huraken charms always works
        (smiling weakly)
        [I heard that part but im gonna assume that that bit got drowned
        in the sound of my laughter]
        [Oh man you should write a book abt this]
        (i already did)
        [Oh then you should put it somewhere coz this memory 
        deserves a prize beyond GOLD HAHAHA!]
