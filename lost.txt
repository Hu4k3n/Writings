Starlit night
Lowlit lamps
Carrying bags
To our homes
On a journey
that we shared

I lost myself in that brightly lit night
I lost myself everytime that we texted
i lost myself whenever we met 
Lost myself deeper in you

You were running
form your chores
So was I
till I met you
You called me up
to say silly things 
Glad you did 
So were you

I lose myself in those brightly lit night
I lose myself everytime that we texted
i lose myself when we met 
Lost myself deeper in you

When you told me 
that ypou met someone 
I was there 
cheering you on
When you left
by saying none
I was there 
still smiling


I lost myself in that dimly lit night
I miss myself when weused to text
i lost myself when we used to meet 
Lost myself in you too deep.
